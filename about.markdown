## Our Story

BoxRent was founded in 2020 by a group of outdoor enthusiasts who recognized a common problem: the need for temporary roof storage solutions without the high cost of purchasing equipment that might only be used occasionally.

What started as a small operation with just 5 roof boxes has grown into the region's premier roof box and roof rack rental service, with over 50 units in various sizes and styles to meet every need.

## Our Mission

At BoxRent, our mission is to make travel and outdoor adventures more accessible and convenient by providing high-quality roof storage solutions at affordable rental prices. We believe that everyone should be able to enjoy the freedom of having extra cargo space without the commitment of purchasing and storing equipment they may only use a few times a year.
